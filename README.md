# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

After completing an analysis for PyBer, a ride-sharing business, the CEO has requested a deeper analysis of the data by city type. The scope of work is to create a summary DataFrame and a multi-line graph of the total weekly fares for each city type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. 

## Results

### Summary DataFrame

  * The Urban city type has more total drivers than total rides, which has a major impact on the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. 
  * The Urban drivers have the lowest average fare per ride and earn significantly less than the Rural drivers.
  * Even though the Rural city type ratio of total rides to total drivers is almost equivalent to the Suburban city type, Rural city type has the highest average fare per driver. 

### Total Fare by City Type

  * All three city types start to rise to a peak at the end for February. 
  * While the Urban city type peak moves back on forth through April, the other two city types slow down throughout March.
  * The Rural city type increases again leading into the month of April, but drops off soon after while the Suburban city type starts to peak again at the end of April.

## Summary

Based on the results, the three recommendations I have to address the disparities among the city types are:
1. PyBer should work on collecting data that include mileage distance to have a better understanding of the summary results. For example: Urban city types collect a lower average fare per ride which might be due to those cities being compact, while Rural city types collect a higher average fare per ride which might be due to those cities being more spread out.
2. Since the total of rides is less than the total of drivers in the Urban city type, PyBer may want to consider investing in advertising to increase the total rides or potentially risk losing Urban drivers because there isn't enough work.
3. Since the total of rides is higher than the total of drives in the Rural city type, PyBer should consider collecting more data because the ride demand is higher than the other two city types and they can attract more drivers by sharing the average fare per ride and drivers.
