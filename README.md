# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

After completing an analysis for PyBer, a ride-sharing business, the CEO has requested a deeper analysis of the data by city type. The scope of work is to create a summary DataFrame and a multi-line graph of the total weekly fares for each city type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. 

## Results

### Summary DataFrame

### Total Fare by City Type

## Summary

Based on the results, the three recommendations I have to address the disparities among the city types are:
1. PyBer should work on collecting data that include mileage distance to have a better understanding of the summary results. For example: Urban city types collect a lower average fare per ride which might be due to those cities being compact, while Rural city types collect a higher average fare per ride which might be due to those cities being more spread out.
